# What is a container?
Simply put, a container is a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on the host machine. That isolation leverages kernel namespaces and cgroups, features that have been in Linux for a long time. Docker has worked to make these capabilities approachable and easy to use. To summarize, a container:

   1. Is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the DockerAPI or CLI.
   2. Can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud.
   3. Is portable (can be run on any OS).
   4. Is isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, and configurations.

in simple word, A container is a bundle of Application, Application libraries required to run your application and the minimum system dependencies.A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
